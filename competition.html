        <h1>Project Submission</h1>
        <p>Submission portal shall open soon. Note the submission deadline of <b>Friday 16 August 2024</b> at 23:59 in your local time. Late submissions without reasonable explanation such as <i>force majeure</i> shall not be entertained.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="s6">
        <h1>Tops and Tips plus FAQ</h1>
        <p><b>Step 1: Conception and Inception.</b> To get started, identify some issues you want to address, then brainstorm how to address it through data sciences and likely also with machine learning. When converging with others, discuss together and form working groups. Eventually, you can find people that work well with you that also share parts of your vision.</p>
        <p><b>Step 2: Creation and Iteration.</b> Think from start to finish what the project would be like, so the project is "complete" in its essence. Then improve in each and all aspects. The basic forms of the Material Submissions 1, 2, and 3 (Proposal, Paper, and Pictures) should be ready.</p>
        <p><b>Step 3: Finalize and Submit.</b> Once you are proud of your <i>n</i>th iteration, submit the Proposal, Paper, and Pictures before the final deadline (August 16th 2024). </p>
        <p><b>Step 4: Finalist Submission.</b> If you are shortlisted, you shall be contacted by the IDSOL 2024 Organizing Committee by September 30th 2024. You will have a chance to make updates to all four of your submissions by the deadline (October 11th 2024).</p>
        <h1>Proposal</h1>
        <p><b>Reading Deck:</b> since this will be literally read by adjudicators without audio aid, you must strike a balance between too much and too little content.</p>
        <p><b>Story Telling:</b> your project is ultimately a story, so how do you want to tell it? For example: here is the problem; here is the way things are done now; here is how we are going do better...</p>
        <p><b>Appendices:</b> anything that is not really part of your story, you can put to the end, in appendices, just like a paper. Unlike a paper that goes all out on details, the balance of too much and too little content is the challenge in making a proposal deck.</p>
        <h1>Paper</h1>
        <p><b>Format:</b> previous competitions committees may have been more lenient on the paper format, but no more! Follow the Paper format (<a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">A4 IEEE Conference Paper</a>)</p>
        <p><b>Appendices:</b> the 4-page limit means you must be very <i>clear</i> and <i>concise</i> in your writing. That means the deep details will be in the appendices. Reference the appendices so the adjudicators can see all the details. If you have diagrams that require high resolution, you may attach them as appendices and override the two-column format.</p>  
        <p>If you have any questions, please <a href="contact.html">contact us.</a></p>
        <h1>Pictures</h1>
        <p><b>Option 1: Present a Reading Deck.</b> present your reading deck. Pros: can just use the same material. Cons: reading decks are not ideal for pitch presentations, i.e. your audience is forced to split their attention listening to you and reading the slides. Yes, adjudicators can hit PAUSE, but they already have the reading deck and this is supposed to be an opportunity for you to have a human conversation :)</p>
        <p><b>Option 2: Present a Pitch Deck.</b> derive a pitch deck from your reading deck or make from scratch. Pros: ideal presentation. Cons: a bit more work.</p>
        <p><b>Option 3: Talking Head.</b> record yourself talking about your presentation. Pros: less work. Cons: no visual aids.</p>
        <p><b>Option 4: Make a "Movie".</b> envision something beautiful and make it happen on iMovie, Windows Movie Maker, Adobe Premier, etc. Pros: it will be epic. Cons: lots of work!</p>
        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p><b>What country should I represent?</b> The one you identify with the most!</p>
        <p><b>My country has an organizing committee, how do I submit?</b> Directly to them. Note their deadlines.</p>
        <p><b>My country has no organizing committee, how do I submit?</b> Directly to us. The IDSOL Ersatz Committee shall nominate you on behalf of your country if your project has the requisite quality among the submissions from your country.</p>
        <p><b>My country has no organizing committee, how do I form one?</b> IDSOL works with academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and other entities with non-profit motives. Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> with a proposal.</p>
        <p><b>Why submit before the deadline?</b> For contestants from countries with no organizing committee, the IDSOL Ersatz Committee may reply with feedback for improvements before the final deadline.</p>
        <p><b>Does IDSOL sponsor my travel and accomodations?</b> No, every team is responsible for their own expenses. If there is an organizing committee in your country, they may have some policies or arrangements. You may also speak to your school or some corporate sponsor about subsidizing part of your journey. In the past, we have facilitated connections to financial assistance or sponsorship. If you would like to explore this option, <a href="contact.html">contact us.</a> with a description of your situation and a proposal for how to proceed.</p>
        <p><b>Do I need a visa or documents to travel?</b> Excellent question, but not for us. The finals are in the <a href="https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/visa-the-netherlands" target="_blank">Netherlands</a>, a country in the <a href="https://www.schengen-visa-info.eu/" target="_blank">Schengen Zone</a> of the European Union. Consult the local embassy, consulate-general, or a similar authority for a better answer suited to your situation.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions, please <a href="contact.html">contact us.</a></p>
